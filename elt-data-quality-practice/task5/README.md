# ETL Testing Strategy

## üìä 1. Data Quality Checks

Ensure the migrated data is **accurate, complete, and consistent**:

### ‚úÖ Validation Steps:
- **Record Counts**: Compare source and target row counts.
- **Data Checksums**: Use hash or checksum to validate data integrity.
- **Field-Level Comparison**: Spot-check key fields (IDs, dates, amounts).
- **Null/Blank Checks**: Ensure required fields are not missing.
- **Referential Integrity**: Validate foreign keys and relationships.
- **Duplicate Check**: Ensure no duplicate records exist post-migration.

## ‚ö° 2. ETL Performance Testing

Ensure the ETL process handles **large volumes efficiently** and finishes on time.

### üöÄ Strategy:
- **Baseline Load Test**: Run ETL with sample production-sized data to benchmark.
- **Volume Testing**: Gradually increase data volume to simulate peak loads.
- **Time Tracking**: Measure start-to-end duration and log bottlenecks.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor CPU, memory, I/O usage during ETL.
- **Parallel Processing**: Use batching or parallel execution to speed up.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure retries, logging, and alerts are in place for failures.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Goals:
- ETL should complete within the defined **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**.
- All data should be migrated **accurately, without loss or corruption**.
- System should stay **stable and responsive** even under high load.
